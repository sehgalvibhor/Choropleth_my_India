# Choropleth_my_India
It's really easy to find Choropleth maps of various countriesbut I faced a challenge finding a similar map for India. So I created one myself, it's based on popular leafleat Choropleth tutorial. It just uses India and specific states(Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh) GEOjson boundaries.

<b>Uses Leaflet.js</b>
